This demo and intermediate-level tutorial shows how to code a grid-based movement as in games like Fire Emblem or Advance Wars.

Features:

- Grid-based movement.
- Cursor to navigate the map and select a unit.
- Displays the unit's walkable area.
- Remembers the cells the user chose to walk through.
- Simplifies the path automatically.
- The user can validate or cancel the movement.
