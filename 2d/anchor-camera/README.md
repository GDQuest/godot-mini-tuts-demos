# Anchoring the camera

Learn to anchor the camera to specific screens when the player enters an area. The camera animates smoothly, moving from anchor to anchor or transitioning to the player.

You can use it to lock the camera to a combat arena or zoom it out and anchor it to a boss in your game for a dramatic effect.
