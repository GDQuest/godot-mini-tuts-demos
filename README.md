# Godot Mini Tuts Demos

![Godot mini tutorials banner](images/godot-mini-tuts-banner.png)

A collection of Free and Open-Source companion demos for our [Godot tutorials](https://www.gdquest.com/tutorial/godot/). Each demo shows how to solve a specific problem.

Each of these demos comes with a corresponding tutorial. In each demo's folder, you will find a document that links to it.
